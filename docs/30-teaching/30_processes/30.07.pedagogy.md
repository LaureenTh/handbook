# 30.07 Pedagogy

This page summarizes pedagogical resources and evidence-based teaching strategies.

## Process of curriculum development (Thomas et al., 2022):

- Step 1 Problem Identification and General Needs Assessment 
- Step 2 Needs Assessment for Targeted Learners 
- Step 3 Goals and Objectives
- Step 4 Educational Strategies 
- Step 5 Implementation
- Step 6 Evaluation and Feedback 

## Syllabus design

- Basic information (Instructor, contact and availability, dates, degree, prerequisites, format online/in person, state whether/when attendance is mandatory)
- Course description with teaching philosophy (link to pedagogical foundations, include safety and inclusiveness statement)
- Goal and learning objectives
- Course outline: contents in a timeline
- Assessment (Grading) and student responsibilities (possibly a "how to succeed" section)
- Materials (access) and resources
