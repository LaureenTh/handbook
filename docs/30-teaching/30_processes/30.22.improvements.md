# 30.22 Improvement

In the following, we document our efforts to improve in teaching lectures, projects, seminars, and theses.

## [OSD WS2324](../33_projects/33.02.osd-ws23-24.html)

Student evaluation: [19.000061](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/f/21480){: target="_blank"}

- Areas for improvement: Planning and presentation, clarity of structure, additional resources
- Clarify the goals for the contribution (issue summaries should be more specific, containing a user story, covering the outcomes/functionality, user interaction)
- More information should be made available on the last session (review session)
- Improve setup (MacOS/Windows): test GitHub Codespaces as an option
- Prepare an additional session (after 2-3 weeks), covering the following:

  - A walk-through explaining `colrev search` and SearchSources (showing the changes in settings and records retrieved), and guidelines in testing code would be helpful.
  - Refresh skills related to Git, gitk, fork, using of branches/pull-requests, issues, and merging.
  - Additional resources (e.g., links to interactive tutorials)
  - Explanations for gitk and Linux shell commands (ls, cs, ...)
  - Workflow utilities (such as storing custom commands in bash_aliases) may be helpful.

Additional notes by instructor and teaching assistants:

- Identify a setting for the last session that scales for multiple groups (e.g., pairs of two?)

## [LRSem WSS23/24](../34_seminars/34.02.lrsem-ws23-24.html)

Student evaluation: [19.000062](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/f/21479){: target="_blank"}

- No suggestions for improvement (very high student satisfaction across all items)

Additional notes by instructor and teaching assistants:

- Setup on GitHub pages
- Include a page with student feedback
- Data analysis: update example for inductive analyiss
- Marp: automatically create slides (html/pdf)
- Include exercise for background tables, research agenda, theory (illustrations of figures and tables)
- Tools: show litsearchr, colrev, biblioshiny
- Address feedback and notes from previous sessions (seminar-notes-1.jpg, seminar-notes-2.jpg)
- Discuss how LRs will change with AI/genAILR
