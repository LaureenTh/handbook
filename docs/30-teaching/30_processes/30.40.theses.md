# 30.40 Theses
{: .no_toc }


The thesis is one of the key accomplishments when studying at a University.
To support you throughout the process, we provide a clear overview of the steps, transparent evaluation criteria, as well as a developmental approach.
An overview of the process is available [here](30.40.theses_process.html).

- A [changelog](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/commits/main/docs/30-teaching/30_processes/30.40.theses.md) is available for this document.
- Information on individual theses is recorded internally ([35 Theses](../35_theses.html)).

{: .note }
This page will primarily contain administration details. For students, information will be available on a [separate page](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/theses/){: target="_blank"}.

## 1. Initial meetings to discuss the general topic

Students can select [open topics](30.40.theses_topics.html) or suggest topics related to our research areas.
To start the process, reach out via e-mail and schedule a meeting to discuss topic and next steps:

To prepare the next step, it is recommended to start developing an exposé.

## 2. Formal admission

Students send the **application for admission** to the thesis to the *examination office* via their Stud e-mail address.
You can use [this e-mail template](30.40.thesis_admission_mail.html).

The examination office **verifies** the admission requirements.

- If admission requirements are met, the topic confirmation is created with text fields so that the topic of the thesis and the date of topic issue can be entered.
- If the admission requirements are not met, the student is notified that the application has been rejected.

The examination office may ask the student to request an **approval by the examination committee** (Prüfungsausschuss) to write a thesis in the area of *Digital Work*.
This is the case when older regulations (Studien- und Fachprüfungsordnung) apply (i.e., when master studies were started before 2018), or for students of Informatics and Applied Informatics (e.g., International Software Systems Science).

Students **receive the topic confirmation** as a (protected) Word document (.docx) by e-mail together with processing/submission instructions as well as inspection statement.
The next step is to make an appointment with the thesis advisor to determine the topic and sign the topic confirmation. The secretary receives this message in CC.

Student and thesis advisor schedule a meeting to determine the topic and **sign the topic confirmation**.
If the appointment is online, you can print and sign the confirmation, and send it to our [postal address](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/digital-work/team/prof-dr-gerit-wagner/){: target="_blank"}.
It is important that we receive **two paper versions with original signatures**:

- 1 original with signature of the professor and the student **for the student**.
- 1 original with signature of the professor and the student **for archiving at the chair** (added to the [19-archive](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/files?dir=/10-lab/19_archive&fileid=62){: target="_blank"}).

Upon completing the topic confirmation, the **thesis advisor moves the documents** to [35 - theses](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/30-30-teaching/35_theses&fileid=124){: target="_blank"}.

To **complete the admission**, the secretary

- Enters the topic of the thesis and date of topic issue in the Word document
- Sends an e-mail containing the Word document to the examination office, which enters topic and the day of topic issue into FlexNow.
- Enters the details in [35.000 - overview](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/30-30-teaching/35_theses/000_overview&fileid=608){: target="_blank"}.

## 3. Thesis writing and feedback sessions

Bachelor's theses are usually due in 4 months, Master's theses in 6 months.
The official requirements can be found in the regulations linked below.
It is not necessary to submit the thesis in the semester in which it was started (unless you would take longer than the maximum duration of study).
For students of Applied Informatics, Software Systems Science, and Computing in the Humanities a practical part is required for Bachelor's and Master's theses.

We encourage students to complete an exposé before writing the thesis.
A thesis must be written in English.
The following resources may be helpful:

- The [evaluation criteria](30.40.theses_criteria.html)
- The [schedule](30.40.theses_schedule.html)
- The thesis template for [markdown](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/thesis-template){: target="_blank"} ([create repository from template](https://github.com/new?template_name=thesis-template&template_owner=digital-work-lab){: target="_blank"}) or [word](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/main/assets/docs/template.docx)
- The [literature review section](../../20-research/20_processes/20.10.literature-review.html)
- The [analysis templates section](../../20-research/20_processes/20.21.analysis-templates.html)
- The [writing section](../../20-research/20_processes/20.29.writing.html) (in particular correct citation practices)
- The [guideline for the use of digital tools](30.40.theses_digital_tools.html)

We offer regular **feedback sessions** (every one to two weeks) to discuss open questions and the next steps:

- Feedback sessions can be in person or online
- They can be scheduled via [calendly](https://calendly.com/gerit-wagner/30min){: target="_blank"}
- To receive feedback on the written document, please

  - share it 1-2 days before the meeting
  - indicate which sections should be read
  - use a file-format suitable for adding comments (pdf or doc/x)
  - use a suitable filename (e.g., `2023-12-01-Thesis-Name.pdf`)

- Internally, we store documents and notes in [35 - theses](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/30-30-teaching/35_theses&fileid=124){: target="_blank"}.

Before submitting the thesis, we encourage students to consult with the [pre-submission checklist](30.40.theses_pre_submission.html).

## 4. Submission of the thesis

Two copies in hard bound form and one digital version each are to be submitted to the examination office.

- During opening hours Mon-Fri 10.00 - 12.00: Hand in the thesis at the examination office (Kapuzinerstr. 25)
- Outside of opening hours: Drop the thesis in the mailbox of the University Administration (Kapuzinerstr. 16)
- Dispatch by mail (the date of the postmark counts) Otto-Friedrich-University, Examination Office - 96045 Bamberg

Note: the digital appendix can be a CD-ROM or USB stick.

## 5. Thesis presentation

- The student must present at her/his master thesis ...
- The thesis advisor and professor set a date for the presentation
- A second examiner is required (check whether this is adequate)
- The grading template is available here (**TODO**)
- Protocols should be archived (digitally / paper versions?)

## 6. Grading

The thesis advisor (professor) grades the thesis based on the [template](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/tree/main/src/thesis_review){: target="_blank"} and the predefined [criteria](30.40.theses_criteria.html).

- The hardback copy of the thesis, which remains at the chair, is stored in the archive room WE5/05.058.
- A thesis is checked for plagiarism based on [Turnitin](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/its/turnitin){: target="_blank"}. In case plagiarism is detected, the [Plagiarism Process](30.52.plagiarism.html) is started.
<!-- generative AI: cannot be detected reliably -->
- If programming is required as part of the thesis, this should be confirmed in the review.
- For master theses, the weight of the written part is 67% and the weight of the presentation is 33% (based on [Master WI MHB](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/fileadmin/abt-studium/Modulhandbuecher/WIAI/WI/Master/MHB_MA_WI_2018.pdf){: target="_blank"}). **Grades for the thesis and the colloquium must be stated separately**.
- The deadline is given by the examination office. Our goal is to grade theses within two weeks (the official deadline allows up to 4 months). 
- The review and grade in paper form (signed by the professor) are sent to the examination office by the secretary (no cover letter, Hauspost: Ref II/3).
- The review (PDF) is archived at [14.04](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/10-lab/14_grades/04_theses&fileid=73){: target="_blank"}. Materials in 35.XXX should be consolidated.
- Grades are entered by the examination office.
- Students can check the grade via FlexNow.

## 7. Feedback session

We provide feedback on the thesis and explain the grading.
A short summary is stored on our [feedback page](30.40.theses_feedback.html) if students agree.
