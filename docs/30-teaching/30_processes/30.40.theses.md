## Formal admission

The administrative process starts with formal thesis registration.

Students send the **application for admission** to the thesis to the *examination office* via their Stud e-mail address.

The examination office **verifies** the admission requirements.

- If admission requirements are met, the topic confirmation is created with text fields so that the topic of the thesis and the date of topic issue can be entered.
- If the admission requirements are not met, the student is notified that the application has been rejected.

The examination office may ask the student to request an **approval by the examination committee** (Pr端fungsausschuss) to write a thesis in the area of *Digital Work*.
This is the case when older regulations (Studien- und Fachpr端fungsordnung) apply (i.e., when master studies were started before 2018), or for students of Informatics and Applied Informatics (e.g., International Software Systems Science).

Students **receive the topic confirmation** as a (protected) Word document (.docx) by e-mail together with processing/submission instructions as well as inspection statement.
The next step is to make an appointment with the thesis advisor to determine the topic and sign the topic confirmation. The secretary receives this message in CC.

Student and thesis advisor schedule a meeting to determine the topic and **sign the topic confirmation**.
If the appointment is online, you can print and sign the confirmation, and send it to our [postal address](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/digital-work/team/prof-dr-gerit-wagner/){: target="_blank"}.
It is important that we receive **two paper versions with original signatures**:

- 1 original with signature of the professor and the student **for the student**.
- 1 original with signature of the professor and the student **for archiving at the chair** (added to the [19-archive](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/files?dir=/10-lab/19_archive&fileid=62){: target="_blank"}).

Upon completing the topic confirmation, the **thesis advisor moves the documents** to [35 - theses](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/30-30-teaching/35_theses&fileid=124){: target="_blank"}.

To **complete the admission**, the secretary

- Enters the topic of the thesis and date of topic issue in the Word document
- Sends an e-mail containing the Word document to the examination office, which enters topic and the day of topic issue into FlexNow.
- Enters the details in [35.000 - overview](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/30-30-teaching/35_theses/000_overview&fileid=608){: target="_blank"}.

## Thesis writing and feedback sessions

- Notes on thesis advising and prrocess are stored internally in [35 - theses](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/30-30-teaching/35_theses&fileid=124){: target="_blank"}.

## Submission of the thesis

Two copies in hard bound form and one digital version each are to be submitted to the examination office.

## Thesis presentation

- The student must present at her/his master thesis ...
- The thesis advisor and professor set a date for the presentation (students can decide whether the presentation should be scheduled before or after the grading)
- A second examiner is required (check whether this is adequate)
- The grading template is available here (**TODO**)
- Protocols should be archived (digitally / paper versions?)

## Grading

The thesis advisor (professor) grades the thesis based on the [template](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/tree/main/src/thesis_review){: target="_blank"} and the predefined [criteria](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/theses/docs/evaluation.html){: target="_blank"}.

- The hardback copy of the thesis, which remains at the chair, is stored in the archive room WE5/05.058.
- A thesis is checked for plagiarism based on [Turnitin](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/its/turnitin){: target="_blank"}. In case plagiarism is detected, the [Plagiarism Process](30.52.plagiarism.html) is started.
<!-- generative AI: cannot be detected reliably -->
- If programming is required as part of the thesis, this should be confirmed in the review.
- For master theses, the weight of the written part is 67% and the weight of the presentation is 33% (based on [Master WI MHB](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/fileadmin/abt-studium/Modulhandbuecher/WIAI/WI/Master/MHB_MA_WI_2018.pdf){: target="_blank"}). **Grades for the thesis and the colloquium must be stated separately**.
- The deadline is given by the examination office. Our goal is to grade theses within two weeks (the official deadline allows up to 4 months). 
- The review and grade in paper form (signed by the professor) are sent to the examination office by the secretary (no cover letter, Hauspost: Ref II/3).
- The review (PDF) is archived at [14.04](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/10-lab/14_grades/04_theses&fileid=73){: target="_blank"}. Materials in 35.XXX should be consolidated.
- Grades are entered by the examination office.
- Students can check the grade via FlexNow.

## Feedback session
