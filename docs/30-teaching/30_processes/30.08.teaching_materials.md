# 30.08 Teaching materials
{: .no_toc }

Best practices and resources for preparing teaching materials.

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

- TOC
{:toc}

## Page

- Each course should have a separate repository and page. 
- Options to provide feedback should be linked on the first page.

## Repository Setup

A teaching repository contains

- A syllabus ([example](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/docs/syllabus.html){: target="_blank"})
- Detailed teaching notes allow teaching assistants to replicate it quickly.
- Links related to continuous improvement: **feedback**, **evaluations**, **improvement**.

Additional checks:

- Dates, rooms, and links should be in one place to prevent inconsistent information.
- VC links never point to a specific course but to a search in VC (e.g., for the [project](https://vc.uni-bamberg.de/course/search.php?search=Digital-Work-Projekt-B){: target="_blank"}).
- Teaching contents are licensed under the [CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en){: target="_blank"} per default.

## Notebooks and Exercises

Per default, we use Jupyter notebooks for exercises.
