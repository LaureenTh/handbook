# 20.30 Pre-submission checklist
{: .no_toc }

This checklist can be used to produce camera-ready papers (initials submissions, revisions, and final versions).
The checks should be completed in order (keep this in mind when updating this checklist).

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

- TOC
{:toc}

## Orga

- Check submission deadline

## Things that cannot be fixed 1h before the submission deadline

- Have a knowledgeable colleague read the paper and provide feedback.
- Consider publishing the data/analyses (e.g., on figshare, github, zenodo).
- Is the research question stated clearly in the first few sentences of  the abstract and the introduction?
- If your article was a reject (or revise) and resubmit, did you clearly fix any concerns?
- Check whether there is previous research in the target journal that can be cited.

## Clarity

- Have any major conceptual changes/prominent phrases been changed recently?
- Consistently use the same terminology (avoid synonyms) of conceptually relevant terms
- Present major conceptual blocks in the same order (same numbering for hypotheses)

## Up-to-date

- Use latest statistics (e.g., including exclusion criteria)
- Use latest model results
- The variables in the background/methodology/results/discussion/intro/abstract/conclusion should be the same

## Template, formatting, and spell-checking

- Used the correct template from the journal website? This might require an additional, external checklist.
- Select and check citation style ([search by example](https://csl.mendeley.com/searchByExample/))

- Check page limit
- Spell-check (e.g., in Word)
  - Check tempus (methodology: simple past)
  - Check common mistakes (e.g., comma for which/who, i.e./e.g. should be in parentheses, using "an" before  vowel sounds, e.g., an hour but a horse)
  - Remove double-spaces: ctrl+h in Word ([1](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/4790))
  - Abbreviations introduced _and_ used consistently?
  - Consistent capitalization (headings, captions, ...)
  - Consistent terminology (e.g., paper vs. article)
  - Use the same decimal separator throughout the paper (. or ,)
  - Consistently spell out numbers less than 10
- Check tables and figures
  - Check references to figures, tables and appendices
  - Are your figures/tables self-contained? You should be able to read the article without looking at the figures/tables and vice versa.
  - Tables:
    - Check alignment of decimals
    - Are table legends appropriate?
    - Are tables embedded into the main text?
    - Have tables been cited in the text?
    - Do the citations refer to the CORRECT table/figure?
    - For better alignment: adjust paragraph -> indentation, margin left/right.
  - Figures:
    - Alignment: Central in article with consistent margins inside the figure.
    - Use the same font-type for the text and the figures.
    - Use vector graphics.
    - Figures should include searchable text (Word: emf/wmf vector graphics)
    - For screenshots: include as PDF with OCR
  - Check figures/tables and include references in the yaml header ([no cite](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#including-uncited-items-in-the-bibliography))
- Check references
  - Go through reference list and check whether there are references that have been included accidentally (different topic)
  - Bibliography: check whether all citations are in the bibliography
  - Direct quotes should include a reference to the specific page
  - Consistent use of "Anonymous" instead of clear author name (if blinding is required)
  - Search paper for "reference" (to catch notes like ("reference needed"))
  - Check in-text citations: correctly cited? separated by semicolons?

The following should not be necessary (when the word/latex reference documents work properly):

- Consistent use of font sizes, types in figures and tables
- Alignment of Headings etc.
- Formatting of footnotes
- Text-alignment/blocks (for all paragraphs)

## Final checks

- Make sure that the paper is anonymous (remove authors from [paper.md](paper.md) before creating the docx/pdf, [inspect word document for personal information](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/remove-hidden-data-and-personal-information-by-inspecting-documents-presentations-or-workbooks-356b7b5d-77af-44fe-a07f-9aa4d085966f))
- Compare with previous version to catch accidental changes (Word: Check, Compare documents)
- Check the PDF. There might be problems when creating the PDF from the word document.
- Update abstract in submission system?

For the revision of conference papers:

- Acknowledge support by a funding body, acknowledge colleagues, reviewers (e.g., "The authors are grateful to the three expert reviewers for their exceptional comments.")
- Include the keywords and abstract in the yaml header of [paper.md](paper.md).
- Check and update metadata (authors, title, ...)
- Latex: Check if .tex writes metadata to PDF (final version, not for submissions/revisions):

```latex
\usepackage[pdftitle={Title of the paper}, pdfauthor={AuthorName FamilyName, AuthorName FamilyName}, pdfkeywords={keyword1, keyword2}]{hyperref}
```

## Post-submission tasks

Upon submission, a PaperID is usually assigned by the submission system.

- paper repository:
  - Create YYYY-MM-DD-JOURNAL_Paper_PaperID.pdf
  - Create YYYY-MM-DD-JOURNAL_Submission_proof_PaperID.pdf
  - Create YYYY-MM-DD-JOURNAL_Revision_sheet_PaperID.pdf
  - Create YYYY-MM-DD-JOURNAL_Cover_letter_PaperID.pdf
  - Link in readme.md (# YYYY-MM-DD Submission to JournalX; [Manuscript](link-to-file))
  - Create git-tag (e.g., icis2021-submission, icis2021-final-version, misq-revision1)
- Analyses repository:
  - Tag git-repo (CHECK whether the data exactly matches the paper!, e.g., compare regression results)
  - Add specific version to Dockerfile (e.g., FROM rocker/tidyverse:3.4.3) - generally avoid using the :latest tag
  - Build dockerfile (docker build .)
  - Run analyses in Dockerfile
  - Save python package versions (pip freeze > requirements.txt)
  - Create git-commit + tag
  - Change Dockerfile to latest (e.g., FROM rocker/tidyverse)
  - to do: add note somewhere on how to restore python package versions (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- Reminder to check the progress of the submission
- Add to waiting for
- Inform coauthors about the submission
- Update personal paper portfolio
- Thank co-authors/research-associates

# Clarity

Things to keep in mind:

 - Did you put a hook into both the abstract and the first paragraph of the article? Even excellent ideas do not sell themselves. So, you must give the sales pitch, the contribution, the unique data, the natural experiment, the current practitioner application, the follow-up to something in that journal, or whatever it is that pulls in the referee, the editor, and the journal readership.
 - Is the research question stated clearly in the first few sentences of both the abstract and the introduction?
 - If your article was a reject (or revise) and resubmit, did you clearly fix any concerns?
 - [ ] Check whether there is previous reserach in the target journal that can be cited.

- [ ] Were there any major conceptual changes/prominent phrases that have been changed recently?
- [ ] Consistently use the same terminology (avoid synonyms) of conceptually releveant terms
- [ ] Present major conceptual blocks in the same order (same numbering for hypotheses)

# Template and Formatting

- [ ] Used the correct template from the journal website? (this might require an additional, external checklist) Check with your co-authors when this requires transferring the whole manuscript from Word to Latex or vice versa.
- [ ] Page limit?
- [ ] Fonts: types and sizes (auch in Grafiken, Tabellen – Alignment of Headings etc.)
- [ ] Zeilenabstand
- [ ] Check Metadata (Authors, Title, ...)
- [ ] Abbreviations introduced AND consistently used (EXCEPT in titles/captions/figures/tables!)

- [ ] formatting of footnotes
- [ ] Check references to Figures, Tables and Appendices
- [ ] doppelte Leerzeichen?
- [ ] check: text-justify

- [ ] Consistent Capitalization
- [ ] Consistent terminology (e.g., paper/article)

- [ ] Check field references to appendices/figures: accidentally included the title?

# Spelling

- export as docx & spell-check
- Tempus (Methodology: simple past)
- , which/who
- i.e., e.g., (with comma)

https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma-before-or/

- a vs. an
  A well known grammar rule says that we should use an before vowel sounds; for example, an accident, an item, an hour. We use a otherwise: a book, a hotel, a university.
  Notice that we say an hour, not a hour. The choice of a or an is based upon the sound of the word, not the spelling. Hour sounds as if it starts with a vowel sound (ow); hence, we use an. Following this rule, we would say a historic, not an historic because   (for most speakers) historic doesn't start with a vowel sound. Words of three or more syllables that start with h are treated differently by some speakers, though. (This may be because of the tendency of some regional accents to drop initial Hs.)
  You only use an when the following sound is a vowel — that you should only look at the letter is a misconception. For example, you would say an hour but a horse, etc.

- its vs it's
  It's is a contraction for it is or it has.
  Its indicates possessive.
  ?!?! <-> http://www.englisch-hilfen.de/grammar/genitiv.htm
  Its' is never correct. Ever.

- 's can be a contraction of is (to be) and has. Also singular possessive!

- to the best of our knowledge

- above-mentioned (UK) vs. abovementioned (US)

- critcism vs critique: Laut dictionary ist “critique” tiefgründiger als “criticism”. “critic” ist aber eine Person die kritisiert.
- [ ] Web of Science is now owned/maintained by Clarivate Analytics, not Thomson Reuters; historically based on the Social Citation Index (SCI) developed by Eugene Garfield

# Tables and Figures

- [ ] Are your figures/tables self-contained? You should be able to read the article without looking at the figures/tables and vice versa. This is overlooked frustratingly often.
- [ ] Have you uploaded any lengthy tables as supplementary files for online publication?
- [ ] Search manuscript for "Verweisquelle"
- [ ] Search for 'p. (' to catch Docear4Word errors


Tables:

- [ ] alignment of decimals (in tables?)
- [ ] Have you provided appropriate table legends?
- [ ] Have you embedded any tables into the main text?
- [ ] Have they been cited in the text?
- [ ] Do the citation refer to the CORRECT Table/Figure?
- [ ] Tabellen-Alignment Probleme:  Absatz, Einzüge, Abstand nach und vor.

Figures:

- [ ] alignment:
  - central in article,
  - consistent margins inside the figure,
- [ ] use the same font-type for the text and the figures
- [ ] Grafiken als Text durchsuchbar (Word: emf/wmf Vektorgrafiken einbinden)
- [ ] Bei Screenshots: als PDF mit OCR einbinden
- [ ] Vektorgrafiken verwenden (nur notfalls Rastergrafiken, in hoher Auflösung), e.g. emf/wmf (for Word)

# Up-to-Date

 - [ ] Use latest statistics (including exclusion criteria)
 - [ ] Use latest model results
 - [ ] The variables in the background/methodology/results/discussion/intro/abstract/conclusion should be the same

# References

 - [ ] Go through reference list and check whether there are references that have been included accidentally (different topic)
 - [ ] Correct Reference Style? (check in-text citations and bibliography, there might be Errors in the CSL-file; e.g., and vs. &)
 - [ ] Bibliography: check whether all Citations are in the Bibliography,
 - [ ] in particular those in footnotes (there might be bugs, e.g. in Docear4Word)
 - [ ] Have all of the references been cited in the text?
 - [ ] check whether references in tables/figures are in the references section
 - [ ] check for (placement) of page references for direct quotes
 - [ ] consistent use of Anonymous instead of clear author name
 - [ ] check if .tex writes metadata to pdf (final version, not for submissions/revisions):
      \usepackage[pdftitle={Title of the paper}, pdfauthor={Gerit Wagner, Ross J. Anderson}, pdfkeywords={data security, eavesdropping}]{hyperref}
 - [ ] check: have all referneces been inserted as Word-Fields (Docear4Word): Mark each paragraph and check whether the references are displayed in darker grey
 - [ ] check AIS. 2011. “Senior Scholars’ Basket of Journals,”. (add Link as url/link field)

 - [ ] search manuscript for "reference" (to catch notes like (reference needed))
