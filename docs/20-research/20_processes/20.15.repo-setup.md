# 20.15 Repo setup

TODO : the repository structure, process/scripts, and best practices for setup will be documented here.

Explanations will show how a paper template/colrev repo/analysis repo is added, effectively integrating 20.20 and 20.21.

TODO : create separate page for collaboration (principles, git workflow), linked to the research process (https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/docs/20-research/)
