# 10.07 Markown
{: .no_toc }

**[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/){: target="_blank"}** is our preferred open-data format for the documentation (website), for writing papers and theses, managing knowledge, and creating slides. It is platform-independent, integrates well with git, and can easily be converted to other formats (e.g., PDF, HTML, DOCX) using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/){: target="_blank"}.

For Markdown documents, please follow these guidelines:

- Begin each sentence in a new line to make the history more readable and to make merging easier (see [semantic line breaks](https://sembr.org/)).

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

- TOC
{:toc}

--- 

## General

- Each sentence should be in a new line (to ensure that the git diff is readable). To create a paragraph, add an empty line.

## Documentation

Links that open in a separate window:

```
[name that displayed](https://website.com){: target="_blank"}
```

## Papers, theses and books

- The [citation syntax](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citation-syntax) (see [CSL](https://citationstyles.org/){: target="_blank"}) is as follows (using the citation keys in the BiBTex file):

```
Citing prior work indirectly [@doe99; @smith2000] or refering to the work of @walter1991.
```
Comments:

```
Regular text
<!-- a comment or link to other materials -->
Text continuing in the same paragraph
```

## Knowledge management

For knowledge management tasks, we use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/){: target="_blank"}.

- Each note (paper summary or concept) should be an a separate, **atomic note** (see [1](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/), [2](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/12-principles-for-using-zettelkasten/51679).
- Paper summaries should have the filename `citation_key.md`, with the *citation_key* corresponding to the ID in a BibTex file.
