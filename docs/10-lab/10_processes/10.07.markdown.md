# 10.07 Markown

**[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/){: target="_blank"}** is our preferred open-data format for the documentation (website), for writing papers and theses, managing knowledge, and creating slides.

It is a markup language, which allows us to creating formatted documents, papers, websites, presentations using plain text (formatting such as headings, lists, bold, italics, and links). It is platform-independent, integrates well with git, and can easily be converted to other formats (e.g., PDF, HTML, DOCX) using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/){: target="_blank"}. Citations can be included via the [CSL](https://citationstyles.org/){: target="_blank"} project.
