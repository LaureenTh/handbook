# 10.10 Handbook

This page explains how to contribute to the handbook.

## How to suggest changes

1. Navigate to the page you would like to change
2. Click on "Edit this page on GitHub", sign in, and the "Edit this file" button
3. Add your changes in [GitHub markdown](https://docs.github.com/de/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax){: target="_blank"}
4. Commit the changes to a new branch
5. Assign the maintainer to review and merge your changes

## Principles

- We prefer simple, structured, and actionable checklists
- Confidential data, such as grades and student identities should not be stored in the handbook
- Add links to other parts of the handbook or external resources to avoid replicating contents
- If the page requires scrolling, add a [table-of-content](https://just-the-docs.com/docs/navigation-structure/#in-page-navigation-with-table-of-contents){: target="_blank"}
- Avoid renaming files or changing the structure of directories. If files need to be renamed, include a redirect in the header:

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: ...
redirect_from:
  - /docs/20-research/20_processes/20.30.pre-submission.html
---

```
