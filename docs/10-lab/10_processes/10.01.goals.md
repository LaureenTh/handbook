# 10.01 Goals

Our team pursues goals in the following areas:

- [Teaching](../../30-teaching/30_processes/30.01.goals.html)
- [Research](../../20-research/20_processes/20.01.goals.html)
- [Funding](../../40-funding)
- [Service](../../50-service)

Resources and responsibilities for team members are linked in the [org](10.02.team.html) page.

Our core values are:

## 🚀 **Impact in research, teaching, and practice**

We challenge ourselves every day to make significant contributions to research on digital work, inspiring students in different teaching formats, and facilitating the application of our work in practice.

## 🛠️ **Rigor, reliability, and reproducibility**

We value rigorous methods that are based on evidence and yield reproducible results. To this end, we select reliable tools and standard operating principles.

## ♻️ **Sustainability, openness, and sharing**

We aim to make our work processes, continuous improvement efforts, and outcomes openly accessible. In particular, we prefer open-source over proprietary technology.

## 🙏 **Support, participation, and diversity**

We build a culture of support, encouraging the participation of different stakeholders, including current and former team members, students, and colleagues. We make diversity our strength.

## 🧑‍🎓️ **Continuous learning**

We believe in continuous growth, setting aside time to learn on a regular basis, and curating helpful resources.

  <summary>How we implement the values and goals</summary>
  1. What we emphasize during [onboarding](10.32.onboarding.html)
  2. All of our teaching efforts follow the [*plan-do-check-adjust* cycle](../../30-teaching/). Our [teaching evaluations](../../30-teaching/30_processes/30.21.evaluations.html) and [improvements](../../30-teaching/30_processes/30.22.improvements.html) are available publicly.
  3. We choose a rigorous manuscript production system, based on Git and Markdown. This allows us to involve students and research assistants in our most important projects, giving them the opportunity to learn and contribute from day one. Without the transparent versioning, reliable control, and effective contribution mechanisms of Git, we would probably "protect the manuscript" and restrict access to our work (e.g., when working with Word).
